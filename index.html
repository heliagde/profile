      <h1> Hello, my name's Hélia :) Welcome to my profile</h1>

      <p>
        I am 18 years old, I have lived in the Yvelines since my birth and I am only French (despite a DNA test revealing that I am also 50% from the Iberian coast). I am preparing a Bachelor in Business Administration in Cergy, but I still live with my parents, my sister and my cat. Besides my studies I am a great romantic. I love to read romances, meditate, take pictures of life's moments and listen to the birds sing when spring arrives. On the other hand, I also love tattoos (I have one), rap and musculation.

      <h2>My insane passion for reading</h2>
      <p>
      	I've been reading for a really long time, but for the past year I've taken a completely different pace since I read 4 to 8 books of 350/400 pages per month, in English, which is not my native language.
        I love US and UK new romance because I've been around the French one and I found the plots redundant. Be careful, it's not a "Jane Eyre" type of romance but it still has its charm. I also read dystopias, very rarely thrillers and non fiction.

       <h2>My taste for weight training</h2>
       <p>I have been going to the gym for almost 3 years now, trying to be regular. Sometimes I go once a week, sometimes 3, depending on my school schedule and my workload. But if I'm not sitting at my desk coding this site, or reading in bed, I'm off lifting weights.</p>

      <h2>My love for food and cooking</h2>
      <p>Like many people my age, I love to eat. Except that I eat in a particular way and I cook myself, rather than ordering or choosing ready-to-eat food. Since I go to the gym, I eat very high protein and pay attention to the fat and sugar content of everything I eat. 
      Sometimes it's a little hard so I have cravings but most of the time I stick with it and the effects on my body and skin are impressive.
